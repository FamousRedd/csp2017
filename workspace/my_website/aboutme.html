  <h2> Hello! My name is Drew.</h2>
  <p>I am a Senior at Lancaster High School. I am an Aerospace Science 4 AFJROTC cadet. 
     My job title in the unit is Wing Com Chief. That puts me third in command of our 290 cadet, cadet run program. 
     My rank is Cadet Chief Master Sergeant(C/CMSgt.). I am a student athlete. 
     I run on my school's Varsity Cross Country and Track teams. I love to run. 
     Outside of the school I play soccer for Quartz Hill AYSO. 
     I also do lots of community service here in my community and for my school. </p>
